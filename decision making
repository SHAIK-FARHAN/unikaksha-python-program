#(6)Y2K Problem Detector
'''Write a program that asks a user for their birth year encoded as two digits (like "62") and for the current year, also encoded as two digits (like "99"). The program is to correctly write out the user’s age in years.

Input Format:

Input consists of 2 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the birth year. 

The second integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the current year.

Output Format:

Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]

Sample Input and Output:

Enter Year of Birth

62

Enter Current year

99

The program will have to determine when a two digit value such as "62" corresponds to a year in the 20th century ("1962") or the 21st century. Here is another run of the program, where "00" is taken to mean the year 2000:

Enter Year of Birth

62

Enter Current year

00

Your age is 38

 Assume that ages are not negative. Another run of the program:

 Enter Year of Birth

27

Enter Current year

#(10)RGY Lights
'''We are driving down the street and see a green traffic light ahead. Because we know precisely the pattern of this traffic light, we know exactly how long we have before it will turn red. We wish to compute whether we will pass the traffic light before it turns red at our current speed.

Write a program that takes the following floating point numbers as input:

our current speed in meter per seconds (s)
the distance to the light in meters (d)
the time until it turns red in seconds (t)
and displays a message indicating whether we will beat the light. You may assume that the input won't be such that we reach the light at exactly the same time it turns red.

 Input Format:

Input consists of 3 lines.

The first line of the input consists of a floating point number which corresponds to the speed,s.
The second line of the input consists of a floating point number which corresponds to the distance,d.
The third line of the input consists of a floating point number which corresponds to the time, t.
Output Format:

Output consists of a string ("yes" or "no").  

Output yes if we will be able to beat the light at current speed. 

Output no if we won't be able to beat light at current speed.
