First integer corresponds to the size of the list 

Next n inputs corresponds to the elements in the list 

Output format: 

Output is an integer list

Sample Input

4  

1 2 3 4

Output

1 2 3 4'''
#program
a=[]
n=int(input( ))
for i in range(1,n+1):
    a.append(int(input()))
print(a)

#(2)Largest number in a list
'''Write a Python Program to find the largest number in a list

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of one list and one integer.

First input consists of a size of a list.

Second inputs corresponds to the size of the list.

Output consists of the largest element.

Sample Input:

5

1

3

6

5

Sample Output:

6'''
#program
a=[]
n=int(input( ))
for i in range(1,n+1):
    a.append(int(input()))
print(max(a))

#(3)Odd or Even
'''Write a Python Program to put the even and odd elements in a list into two different lists.

Input & Output Format:

Input consists of one integer and one list.

First input consists of the size of the list.

Second input consists of the elements based on the size.

Output consists of two lists.

First list consists of all the even numbers in the list.

Second list consists of all the odd numbers in the list.

Sample Input & Output:

5

1

2

3

6

5

The even list [2, 6]

The odd list [1, 3, 5]'''
#program
a=[]
even=[]
odd=[]
n=int(input())
for i in range(0,n):
    a.append(int(input()))
for i in a:
    if(i%2==0):
        even.append(i)
    else:
        odd.append(i)
    print("The even list",even)
    print("The odd list ",odd)
*---------------------------------------------------*
#(4)Array Mean
'''Write a program to find the mean of the elements in the array. 

Input Format: 

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array. 

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array. 

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20. 

Output Format: 

Output consists of a double value which corresponds to the mean of the array.

 Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications. [All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.]

Sample Input and Output : 

5

2

4

1

1

Sample Output:

 2.2
 #program
 a=[]
sum=0
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,n+1):
    a.append(int(input( )))
for i in a:
    sum=sum+i
print(sum/n)
