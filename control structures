#(1)Amoeba Multiplication
'''The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]

Sample input and Output 1:

Enter the number of Months :

7

The amoeba size is 8

Sample input and Output 2:

Enter the number of Months :

12

The amoeba size is 89'''
